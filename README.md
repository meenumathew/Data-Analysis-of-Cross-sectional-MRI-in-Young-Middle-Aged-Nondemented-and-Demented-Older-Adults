# Data Analysis of Cross-sectional MRI in Young Middle Aged Nondemented and Demented Older Adults
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting millions of people worldwide. "We have known for a long time that the brain shrinks in Alzheimer's disease and you can detect this on MRI," says researcher Linda K. McEvoy, PhD, assistant professor of radiology at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. In this paper, I am planning to collect data about cross-sectional MRI data among people under different age and visualise it effective manner in order to reveal better clarification bout Alzheimer’s disease.

# I. Data Set

I have downloaded csv file ‘MRI and Alzheimer’s  from ( https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers?select=oasis_longitudinal.csv  ).The dataset consists of a longitudinal MRI data of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 and everyone is right-handed.( This data set includes 373 records and 15 attributes (5 float ,5 integer values, and 5 string values)). Each subject was scanned at least once.72 of the subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' throughout the study.64 of the subjects were grouped as 'Demented' at the time of their initial visits and remained so throughout the study.14 subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as 'Demented' at a later visit. These fall under the 'Converted' category.

# Column Descriptors


Among the 3 aspects of big data such as volume, velocity and variety, I tried two consider two factors (volume and velocity) for choosing data set. The selected data set is real time data collected from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS).
